# Railway ChromaDB Multi-Tenant Setup - Next Steps

## Quick Summary

Your ChromaDB is **almost ready** for multi-tenant support. You just need to add a few environment variables to your Railway deployment.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Add These Environment Variables to ChromaDB Service in Railway

Go to your ChromaDB service in Railway and add:

```bash
ALLOW_RESET="True"
```

That's it! Your setup already has:
- ✅ Official ChromaDB image (supports multi-tenant)
- ✅ Authentication enabled (token auth)
- ✅ Persistence enabled
- ✅ Proper IPv6 support

### 2. Update Chroma MCP Code

The code has been updated to support token authentication for AdminClient. This change is already committed and pushed to GitHub.

### 3. Deploy and Test

After adding `ALLOW_RESET="True"`:

1. **Redeploy ChromaDB service** in Railway
2. **Pull latest Chroma MCP code** (already has token auth support)
3. **Test admin functions**:
   ```bash
   # These should now work
   chroma_list_databases
   chroma_create_database --database "test_db"
   chroma_delete_database --database "test_db"
   ```

## What Will Happen

### If Multi-Tenant Works:
- `chroma_list_databases` will show actual databases
- You can create/delete databases
- Full AdminClient functionality available

### If Multi-Tenant Doesn't Work:
- Functions will gracefully fallback
- `chroma_list_databases` will show current database with a note
- Create/delete will return clear error messages
- **No breaking changes** - everything else continues working

## Testing Script

Save this as `test_multitenant.py` and run it:

```python
import os
from chromadb.admin import AdminClient
from chromadb.config import Settings

# Your Railway configuration
settings = Settings()
settings.chroma_server_host = os.getenv('CHROMA_HOST', 'localhost')
settings.chroma_server_http_port = os.getenv('CHROMA_PORT', '8000')

# Token authentication
auth_token = os.getenv('CHROMA_CUSTOM_AUTH_CREDENTIALS')
if auth_token:
    settings.chroma_client_auth_provider = "chromadb.auth.token_authn.TokenAuthClientProvider"
    settings.chroma_client_auth_credentials = auth_token
    settings.chroma_client_auth_token_transport_header = "Authorization"

try:
    admin = AdminClient(settings)
    databases = admin.list_databases()
    print(f"✅ Multi-tenant is working! Found {len(databases)} databases")
    for db in databases:
        print(f"  - {db.name}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Multi-tenant not available: {e}")
    print("\nMake sure ALLOW_RESET=True is set in Railway")
```

## Why This Works

1. Your Docker image uses `ghcr.io/chroma-core/chroma:latest` - the official image with full features
2. Token authentication is already configured and working
3. The only missing piece is `ALLOW_RESET=True` which enables database operations

## No Risk Approach

If you're concerned about breaking changes:

1. **Clone your ChromaDB service** in Railway
2. **Add `ALLOW_RESET=True`** to the clone
3. **Test with the clone** first
4. **Switch over** when confident

## Timeline

- **Step 1**: Add environment variable (2 minutes)
- **Step 2**: Redeploy (5 minutes)  
- **Step 3**: Test (10 minutes)
- **Total**: ~20 minutes to full multi-tenant support

The beauty is that even if multi-tenant doesn't work for some reason, the Chroma MCP functions will gracefully fallback and continue working with your current setup.
